@0 = ~What a pity that our time went by so quickly.~
@1 = ~We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. We feel refreshed... and stronger!~
@2 = ~As a small thank you for all the energy you have given us, I gift you with my part of a talisman...~
@3 = ~Oh yes, you're right, Vohraris! Here, take my part of the necklace too. And now let's get out of here, beloved.~
@4 = ~Farewell, handsome <PRO_RACE>!~
@5 = ~At least a little longer...~
@6 = ~Hail, big, strong <PRO_RACE>! You look tired. Won't you lay down with us for a while? We have warm, soft pillows, and your company would be most welcome. So we can brighten the gray hours of the night with a little joy.~
@7 = ~Oh yes, my enchanting friends, we are here to cast you under our spell of temptation. Feel the passion in the air!~
@8 = ~Leave <CHARNAME> alone! You are not worthy of us!~
@9 = ~You are nothing but cheap tarts. If this is what the Succubi's much-vaunted powers of seduction are supposed to be, we needn't worry about the future of the Multiverse.~
@10 = ~Unholy beings, your powers of seduction may be powerful, but our hearts are devoted to truth and justice. Your temptations will not fall on fertile ground.~
@11 = ~Your temptations are void before the power of my faith. Our duty is clear, and we will stand firm and not succumb to your promises.~
@12 = ~What a pathetic attempt to twist a mortal around your finger. That might work on a lowly human, but not on a Drow!~
@13 = ~Not interested.~
@14 = ~I can't quite get into the mood in this ghastly chamber.~
@15 = ~I'm here to pass the test and not be distracted by temptation.~
@16 = ~The passion you hold out to me is nothing but a pretext to corrupt my soul, vile fiends!~
@17 = ~The only temptation I feel is to destroy you, vicious demons!~
@18 = ~Nothing better than that!~
@19 = ~But why resist the desire for tenderness and pleasure? You could forget all your worries and duties and just let yourself fall into our arms.~
@20 = ~We could show you a world where only lust and desire reign. All you have to do is surrender to us.~
@21 = ~I will not deviate from my path. My focus is on accomplishing my task and not on sensual distraction.~
@22 = ~Your sweet words cannot hide your black heart, fiends!~
@23 = ~Let's go!~
@24 = ~But just think of the ecstasy that awaits you! No worries, no responsibility. Only boundless pleasure.~
@25 = ~Your resilience is admirable, but the desire pulsates within you, we can feel it! Why suppress it?~
@26 = ~Still not interested.~
@27 = ~Because I have realized that true strength lies in resisting temptation and maintaining my inner balance. I will not be ruled by my instincts!~
@28 = ~Do you dare to reject our seductive arts and stand firm, wretched mortal? We will not tolerate that!~
@29 = ~Your strength will prove weak if we unleash our demonic power against you!~
@30 = ~You missed the chance to revel in the intoxication of our caresses, now you must drown in your own blood!~
@31 = ~That's right. Lie down with us, close your eyes, surrender to your feelings...~
