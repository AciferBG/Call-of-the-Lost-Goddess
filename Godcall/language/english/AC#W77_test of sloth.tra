Where shadows dance and horrors blight,
Your breath whispers in death's embrace,
Darkness descends, veiling this place.~

Where ghosts whispered and demons paced,
They lure you into their somber domain,
Where time fades and light wanes again.~

A whisper, a sigh, a haunting insistence,
Lost souls entice, drawing you below,
Into depths of inertia, where the Abyss does grow.~

In dreams, compulsion's grip grows strong,
You'll succumb, descend so deep,
Drowning finally in inertia's keep.~
