@0 = ~Hail, mortal being. I see your restless eyes. What do I have to gain here, you wonder! What can I get for myself from this chamber? Well, I have a generous offer for you, so listen carefully.~ [OGREM01.WAV]
@1 = ~See this old, decrepit man next to me? Don't bother trying to talk to him. I've cut out his tongue, and he can't hear you either. But he possesses something you could claim for yourself â€” a magical ring, a truly potent one. It's the sole valuable possession he cherishes in this wretched place! But why does he still cling to it? The ring could belong to you. It is destined to be yours!~
@2 = ~Why not seize it? It would be effortless to end the man's life here and now. No witness, no mourner. And then, you would possess this mighty magical ring, a valuable asset for your upcoming ventures in the Abyss!~
@3 = ~A clumsy attempt to invoke envy in a mortal, nothing more. I would have expected better from a demon in such a place.~
@4 = ~Why would an old man possess a powerful item? Nothing but lies to unsettle us.~
@5 = ~You don't expect to believe, demon, that I - a paladin - would allow anyone here to value a ring over a man's life! Get out, along with your malicious intentions.~
@6 = ~I am supposed to kill someone to enrich myself with their belongings? I do no such thing!~
@7 = ~I don't know...~
@8 = ~How do I know you're not tricking me?~
@9 = ~You're right! It would be a shame if this ring were to remain in the possession of such an old and fragile being!~
@10 = ~You have done it! You have truly done it! Fabulous! You have passed the task, the exit is open to you. With that, my mission here is complete, and I shall depart...~
@11 = ~Why would I do that? My task is to dissuade mortals from the naive-righteous path, not to deceive them.~
@12 = ~No life should be ended for a ring!~
@13 = ~Alright, I'll kill the man and take the ring.~
@14 = ~What are you dawdling about? Kill the old man, take the ring, it should be yours!~ //[OGREM01.WAV]
@15 = ~I won't kill anyone for a ring!~
@16 = ~So, what say you? Have you scrutinized the ring up close? Witnessed its potency and the dazzling allure it radiates? Imagine how much it could enhance your own capabilities. It's unfortunate that it must now be returned to its unrightful owner...~ //[OGREM01.WAV]
@17 = ~Or do you wish to keep it?~
@18 = ~Take this cursed ring, I don't want it!~
@19 = ~In fact, I have no intention of giving it back.~
@20 = ~What a pity. Nevertheless, the exit is open to you. I'll take the old man's life and leave. And you will have to deal with your own envy-ridden desires.~
@21 = ~A wise decision! Envy is the most beautiful of all bad habits, because you are immediately rewarded when you yield to it, remember? You have passed the task, the exit is open to you. Keep the ring, I'll take the old man's life and leave. ...~
@22 = ~Oh, you don't have it anymore! I suppose you hid it? Dropped it to have to pick it up again later? What a clever <PRO_RACE> you are! All due respect. Well, you've passed the task, the exit is open to you. Farewell to you. I no longer need the old man. I can always look for a new one...~
@23 = ~Well, what is it? Have you considered it?~
@24 = ~Behold this ring, mortal! Do you not feel its captivating power? With it in your grasp, imagine how effortlessly you could triumph in battle.~
@25 = ~The man will temporarily lend you the ring. Examine it closely before he requests its return...~
@26 = ~No, keep the ring, I don't want it!~
@27 = ~I can take a look at it...~
@28 = ~Right, right, a quick look can't hurt. But hurry up, because you'll have to return the ring shortly...~
@29 = ~Then hurry up before someone else takes the ring!~
