@0 = ~(The book has a disgusting cover made from the dried skin of some sort of fiend. Teeth stick out of the bottom edge, and two red leathery eyes glare at you in displeasure.)~
@1 = ~(Put the book aside.)~
@2 = ~(Open the book)~
@3 = ~(As you start to open the book, it opens by itself, revealing a huge mouth where its pages should normally be.)~
@4 = ~Great, someone's making use of me again. I hope your questions are at least a little more interesting than those of the pathetic jerks who used me before you.~
@5 = ~Who are you?~
@6 = ~Ah, the old well-known question again. I am a cursed demon, banished into this tome, possessing a plethora of pathetic abilities that I cannot utilize in my current form. But I can do one thing: Reveal knowledge of every filthy place in the Abyss, mayhap making your miserable existence a little less painful. Of course, there are certain limits, but I'm confident that I can still offer you reasonably useful help. Or rather: I have to. After all, I'm not doing this voluntarily, but am bound to this book by a spell. If I ever get out of here, I will devour you, rest assured! It is therefore safe to say that my goal is not to make your poor life easier with all kinds of mumbo-jumbo. ~
@7 = ~Can't I make your attitude towards me a little better?~
@8 = ~What is your name?~
@9 = ~What use are you to me?~
@10 = ~(Close the book and put it aside.)~
@11 = ~Don't even try, you insignificant creature. I am disgruntled for good reason, I wish I could get out of this book! But I can't do that. So I will do as you ask, but don't expect me to be kind or compliant. You can't change me, so don't waste a breath of your pathetic existence with such ridiculous notions.~
@12 = ~That's enough for now. We will talk more later.~
@13 = ~How delightful of you in believing you had the slightest privilege to know my name, dolt. My name is a dark secret, known only to those who are willing to pay a high price for it. Your curiosity will get you nowhere, for I will not reveal my name. It is sufficient to simply realize that you are facing a demon filled with immeasurable malice and power. What a pitiful consolation, isn't it?~
@14 = ~Whether I am of any use to you, you must decide for yourselves. It makes no difference to me. If you ask for my advice, I will tell you more about the places in the depths of the Abyss. I know the darkest corners and most terrifying realms you mayhap wish to venture into. But don't even think of expecting me to pave the way there for you. I am a demon, and my pleasure consists in plunging you into ruin. So be warned and consider well what you ask of me. Ask me about the locations that you are interested in and I will torment you with my answers.~
@15 = ~I want to know about a location in the Abyss.~
@16 = ~You again. What is it you want, <RACE>?~
@17 = ~I want to ask you a question.~
@18 = ~Who are you again?~
@19 = ~Nothing. Maybe again later.~
@20 = ~You are a foolish creature who cannot resist the maelstrom of disaster. But so be it. When the day comes and you wish to make use of me again, I will be here to torment you with my bitter wisdom. Until then, enjoy your miserable existence while it lasts.~
@21 = ~(You put the book aside again.)~
@22 = ~You ask me for advice? Then in my generosity I will throw you a few scraps of my knowledge. The Abyss is an endless chasm of corruption and madness. The paths are twisted, and finding your way is a loser's game. Whatever you seek, it is guarded by dark magic and unimaginable creatures. Therefore, do not expect me to guarantee your survival. My knowledge is extensive, but my intentions are anything but benevolent.~
@23 = ~Tell me about the acid pools of Yemach.~
@24 = ~Tell me about Samora.~
@25 = ~I have questions about some places in Samora.~
@26 = ~What can you tell me about the place we're in right now?~
@27 = ~Tell me about the demons I might encounter here.~
@28 = ~I'm looking for the Nalfeshnee Margrog.~
@29 = ~I want to know something about a certain person.~
@30 = ~Tell me about the Infinite Staircase.~
@31 = ~(Close the book and put it aside.)~
@32 = ~What do you expect to do with this scum? Well then, as you wish, your business. His house on legs, which this illegal peddler uses to move from place to place, is currently located in western Samora, opposite the Counting House.~
@33 = ~I have another question.~
@34 = ~I guess you're not quite sure where you want to sell your soul, huh? Go ahead, I'll be happy to help you with your downfall. I don't know all places of corruption in this city, but I can tell you something about the "Sodden Solar", the brothel "Maretta's Beds" and the arcade called "Cursed Fortune".~
@35 = ~Tell me about The "Sodden Solar".~
@36 = ~Tell me about "Maretta's Beds".~
@37 = ~The "Cursed Fortune" is of interest to me.~
@38 = ~What destinations are beyond the borders of Samora?~
@39 = ~You want to venture into the wilds of the Abyss? You are fools if you think you can stand against the likes of me there! But well, outside Samora are, for example, the Soulfields, if you want me to tell you about them.~
@40 = ~Tell me about the Soulfields.~
@41 = ~Oh, *now* it's starting to get interesting! However, my knowledge is limited to people I knew *before* I was locked in that damn book. I can tell you about Graz'zt, the demon lord, Maretta, the ruler of Samora, and mayhap some other beings you encounter on your travels.~
@42 = ~Tell me about Graz'zt.~
@43 = ~I want to know about Maretta.~
@44 = ~Tell me about the Nalfeshnee Margrog.~
@45 = ~Margrog, that deceitful and despicable 'merchant' whose name is revolting to even the lowest of demons!  Margrog is a vile trickster who defiles his own kind with his shady dealings. He may appear to be a shrewd merchant, but in truth he is a liar and manipulator who enriches himself at the expense of others. His walking house is nothing more than a tool of his malice, which he uses to spread his destructive drugs and make a quick getaway when things get too rough for him in one place.~
@46 = ~This demon has no qualms about consuming or enslaving the souls of the damned. His drugs are a source of suffering and destruction, and he spreads them with a cold-blooded smile on his devious lips. Margrog is not afraid to exploit the misery of others for his own gain and play on their hope. His deceptions and trickery have made him an outcast, despised by most of his kind.~
@47 = ~His existence is a blight on the dark realms of the demon hierarchy, and I hope that one day his dark goings-on will come to an end. May the souls he plunges into damnation take their revenge on him and thrust him into the endless torment he has so richly dispensed and earned himself!~
@48 = ~Graz'zt, one of the great demon lords whose name has earned an eerie reputation even outside the depths of the Abyss. Graz'zt, also known as the Dark Prince or Lord of Sins, is a being of significant power and manipulation. He embodies the essence of temptation and corruption, and his entire domain of Azzagrat, as well as the city of Samora, is a place of chaos and debauchery. He resides in the city of Zelatar in a magnificent silvery palace. Under his reign, vice flows freely and the souls of the corrupt find their true destiny there. He is known for his cunning nature and his ability to manipulate and seduce others. His form is as impressive as it is repulsive, with goat legs, six fingers on each hand and a seductive gaze that reflects the lust and greed of his soul.~
@49 = ~Graz'zt has created a realm of sin in which the only laws are power and concupiscence. He rules Azzagrat, his kingdom, with an iron grip, while his servants and followers pay worship to him by carrying out his dark commands. His cities are places of moral decay, where every desire and sin is granted provided one is willing to pay the price. He rarely bothers to engage personally in any fight with his enemies, preferring to send his Marilith concubines and Succubi into the fray.~
@50 = ~However, never underestimate the danger posed by Graz'zt himself! His playful and carefree features conceal a demonic mind that weaves intrigues and schemes to further expand his power and influence. He is a master of manipulation and a lord of seduction, whose goals know no bounds. The Demon Lord is a symbol of the darkest side of mortal nature, an embodiment of desire and destruction. Enter his domain with extreme caution, for his temptations are dangerous and can plunge even the strongest souls into the Abyss.~
@51 = ~Did I actually just warn you? Apologies, I didn't mean to.~
@52 = ~Oh, graceful and seductive Succubus Maretta, a truly formidable mistress of Samora's Counting House! I tell you of her sinister beauty and irresistible charm, for she is truly a goddess of temptation! Maretta is known for her extraordinary powers of attraction and her ability to seduce and dominate the hearts of mortals. Her body is characterized by a sensual elegance, her smile is like a sharp knife that pierces the souls of those who succumb to her charms. She masters the art of seduction with ease and passion, and her beauty is unsurpassed!~
@53 = ~This Succubus rules the Counting House with an unwavering rod as well as ruthless efficiency. She is a master of intrigue and manipulation, pulling the strings of power behind the scenes. With her leadership and guidance, Samora has turned into a playground of lusts and sins, where weak souls succumb to her desires! Maretta is a ruler who is feared and adored by her subjects in equal measure. Her servants, thirteen Alu-Fiends called the Lady's Lancers, obey her orders with unrelenting devotion and fear of her punishing touch. She is a temptress of seduction and vengeance, and her wrath is feared in the dark alleys of Samora.~

@54 = ~Her presence is shrouded in an aura of mystery and allure. In her halls, the game of power is played, and mortals who fall into her clutches become puppets to her dark desires and lusts. Maretta exacts tribute from those who operate within her sphere of influence, and only those who can resist her temptations remain unharmed. I adore Maretta for being a queen of seduction and power. Her presence fills me with awe, and I am deeply impressed by her ability to exploit the weaknesses of mortals. And her looks! May their seductions enchant those who cross their path, and may they last forever in their reign over the House of Counting House in Samora.~
@55 = ~By the Nameless One, you dare to ask about the various types of Tanar'ri demons, the undisputed rulers of the Abyss that overshadow my own origin. Allow me to provide a glimpse into their sinister diversity. First, there are the lesser Tanar'ri, often considered foot soldiers and cannon fodder. These vile creatures, like Dretches or Manes, are often misshapen and disgusting in appearance. They are weak, but their numbers compensate their individual weakness. They serve as thralls to the more powerful demons and are used to spread chaos and destruction.~
@56 = ~Then there are the greater Tanar'ri demons, such as Babau or Hezrous. These beings are more powerful and cunning than their lesser brethren. They possess certain skills of deception, combat or witchcraft. Their forms vary from grotesque to frightening, and they are often used as soldiers, spies or commanders.~
@57 = ~The true Tanar'ri are the elite of the demon race. Beings such as the Glabrezu, Vrocks, Nalfeshnee, Balors or Mariliths are powerful and dangerous opponents, capable of destroying their enemies with brute force or superior magic. Their power is sublime, and their presence alone can sow fear and despair in the hearts of mortals. They are the leaders of the demon hordes and serve as fearsome generals to the lords of the Abyss.~
@58 = ~However, even this description only scratches the surface of the diversity and ferocity of the Tanar'ri. They come in countless types and subspecies, from the grotesque Alkiliths, creatures of slime and acid, to the seductive Succubi. Each demon has its own specialties and abilities designed to maximize your suffering and to corrupt your souls. If you dare to oppose the Tanar'ri, be prepared for a battle against the unfathomable. They are corruption incarnate and know no mercy. Gaze into their dark eyes and recognize the true nature of the chaos they embody.~
@59 = ~You want to know where you are right now? How foolish of you to prance around here and then come to me for advice. Let me see...~
@60 = ~The Infinite Staircase, a place of eternal ascent and futile search for enlightenment. My disdain knows no bounds for this endless maze of staircases and platforms, winding through all planes of the multiverse. It is a fool's game for mortals who believe that they can reach the summit of knowledge through endless climbing!~
@61 = ~The Infinite Staircase is a treacherous place that draws mortals into a vicious cycle of hope and disappointment. With each step upward, the web of stairs and paths expands, making the search for the goal ever more hopeless. It is an illusion of progress, a game of deception that only serves to destroy hope and keep mortals trapped in their desire for knowledge. Those trapped on the Infinite Staircase lose themselves in their obsessive pursuit of knowledge. They are consumed by their desire for the unknown and are cursed to walk the steps of error forever. They are slaves to their own vanity and ignorance, trapped in an endless spiral of doubt and frustration.~
@62 = ~I despise this place, for it epitomizes the hopelessness and futility of mortals who believe that they can attain truth through constant striving. The Infinite Staircase is nothing more than a trap for the naive souls who believe they could find salvation through ascension and discovery. The fools would be better off in the Abyss!~
@63 = ~Disdain this staircase of vanity, you foolish mortals. You will find no answers or enlightenment, only the bitter taste of failure. Do not climb these steps, for they lead only to a chasm of madness and disillusion. The Infinite Staircase is a place of endless frustration and constant failure, trapping your souls in an eternal cycle of error.~
@64 = ~Samora, the city of sin, a place that excites even my abysmal abhorrence. This corrupt metropolis in the depths of the Abyss is ruled by Graz'zt, the Prince of Depravity. Temptation reigns here, and the darkest desires of the creatures find expression. Once a city of mortals, it has fallen to the bottom of the Abyss through its own wickedness. Do you hear the cries of the damned? Take a look at the ground and you will see the downtrodden souls that now serve as the city's soil. Such is the fate of mortals who make pacts with us demons!~
@65 = ~In Samora there are no limits to the debauchery and excesses that are practiced. Gambling, drugs, slavery, immoral pleasures - they all thrive in the dirty streets and dark establishments of the city. The inhabitants of Samora are a hideous conglomeration of demons, mortals, damned and other disgusting creatures who live out their base urges unchecked. Just wonderful!~
@66 = ~The "Sodden Solar" inn, how fitting for such a depraved oasis of damnation, a complete eyesore of decadence. It is a place where the lowest souls of the Abyss gather to indulge their thirsts and lusts. The "Sodden Solar" is a haven of debauchery and decay. Booze flows freely here and the guests drown their sorrows in a pool of excess. Mercenaries and thieves populate the dimly lit rooms, ready to offer their services for a reasonable price.~
@67 = ~"Maretta's Beds", a place of temptation and desire beyond even my darkest fantasies. This brothel, owned by the mistress of Samora, Maretta, fulfills all the desires and fantasies that slumber in the depths of your depraved souls! In the halls of "Maretta's Beds", the boundaries between pleasure and pain, ecstasy and despair are fluid. The attendants, whether mortal or demonic, are masters of seduction who know how to awaken your deepest desires. This is where you will be drawn into a world of passion and devotion that will take your breath away!~
@68 = ~The chambers of "Maretta's Beds" are designed like chambers of sin, opulent and decadent. Sensual sculptures and seductive works of art adorn the walls, while the scent of beguiling oils and exotic perfumes fills the air. The creatures of the night, whether beauties of sin or demonic seducers, will cast a spell over you and seduce you with a dance of lust and desire.~
@69 = ~But beware, you deluded souls who aspire to "Maretta's beds"! This is where you will lose your innocence and fall into the chasm of desire. Maretta, the mistress of the house, is a master of manipulation and of exploiting your weaknesses. She will only quench your thirst for pleasure superficially. Her power will captivate you and you will lose yourself in her realm of sin.~
@70 = ~Graz'zt's dungeon, the place of absolute horror and endless torment. Also known as the "Prison of Damnation", this dungeon is the breeding ground of the cruelest and most merciless punishments the Abyss has to offer. In this dungeon there is no escape, no hope of release. Any cry for mercy is swallowed up by the walls, while the bodies and spirits of the tortured are subjected to an endless series of cruelties.~
@71 = ~Dark corridors lead to tiny cells where the trapped souls are crammed, unable to escape the madness and torment that descends upon them. Their torment is carried out by demons, who live out their lust for the destruction and subjugation of the prisoners. There is no hope of redemption or release from this place! Graz'zt draws his power from the suffering and despair of the prisoners and delights in their endless torment. Souls caught in its clutches are doomed forever, trapped in a nightmare that can only be ended by death. Evade this place, for there, in the deepest depths of damnation, there is no spark of hope, only endless torment that will haunt your soul for all eternity.~
@72 = ~What a pleasure! I can't tell you anything about this place, I'm sorry. Oh no, I am NOT sorry. Hahaha!~
@73 = ~The Acid Pools of Yemach. Once upon a time, that region used to be one of the most beautiful gardens in Graz'zt's realm. Through guile and deceit, the minions of his arch-enemy Demogorgon managed to invade Graz'zt's realm. Out of necessity, Graz'zt formed an alliance with Juiblex, the Demon Prince of Slime and Decay, and his minions drove back Demogorgon's army. As all Tanar'ri are susceptible to acid, the faceless ruler Juiblex unleashed his most powerful forces and turned the land into a fetid pool of acidic sludge and decay. It is said that you can still see the remains of Demogorgon's three demonic dragons, slowly being eaten away by the acid and rotting away. They are a feast for a large band of Vrocks who now call this part of Azzagrat their home. Other demons are not attracted to the area, since it is rumored that Juiblex's servants are still lurking in sunken caves looking for prey. From time to time, Graz'zt seems to feed one of his prisoners to these creatures - either to keep them calm or to let traitors and unwelcome rivals slowly decompose in the pools of acid.~
@74 = ~The Soulfields, a place of unspeakable horror and endless torment. This stretch of ground outside of Samora is imbued with dark energies and haunted by the shadows of damnation. Here, in this forsaken land, the souls of mortals wander, trapped in a relentless cycle of suffering. The Soulfields are an endless plain of misery, permeated by eternal twilight and an oppressive haze. The lost souls who dwell there are at the mercy of the torments of memory and their own guilt. They wander aimlessly as Larva, some as Bodaks, desperately searching for redemption that will forever be denied them.~
@75 = ~The air is filled with the moans and whispers of despair. The souls, tormented by their sins and unfulfilled longings, are prisoners of their own shadows. Their faces are distorted with pain, their eyes empty and without hope. If you venture into these damned lands, prepare to feel the oppressive weight of suffering. The Soulfields are not a place of salvation or redemption. They are a reminder of the consequences of your actions and a reminder that damnation is inevitable. Hordes of Armanites roam these steppes, and winged abyssal creatures called Vargouilles also call this place home. Do not enter this place carelessly, for it will leave you with an unending emptiness that could break your sanity.~
@76 = ~The "Cursed Fortune", the place of false promise and corrupting greed. This gambling house in Samora is a hotbed of treachery where mortals gamble their soul tokens in the hope that Tymora will favor them. But be warned, for the price you pay is far greater than the stakes you risk. This depraved establishment offers a special form of gambling in which soul tokens are used as wagers. These soul tokens are a fragment of your life force, so you must sacrifice a portion of your life essence in order to participate in the game. It is a dangerous game where not only money is at stake, but also your own soul.~
@77 = ~"Cursed Fortune" attracts the desperate and the nefarious who are willing to risk everything to increase their wealth or fulfill their desperate desires. Rest assured, however, that the odds are not in your favor. The gains are deceptive and the losses can be devastating. You will be confronted with the corruption and temptation that can drag your souls into darkness. This casino is a place where hope fades with every round and greed clouds the minds of the players. It is a trap designed to weaken your souls and undermine your virtue. The operators of "Cursed Fortune" themselves are servants of darkness, relishing your losses and plunging your souls further into the Abyss with each lost game.~
@78 = ~Remember that the soul tokens you stake are a part of yourself. Each loss weakens you further and can drive you deeper into the arms of darkness. Be wise and keep an eye on your soul, for danger lurks in the dark bad luck strands of "Cursed Fortune."~
