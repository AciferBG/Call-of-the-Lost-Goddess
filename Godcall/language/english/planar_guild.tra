@0 = ~I have weapons and equipment for you, if you need them.~
@1 = ~I would like to buy something.~
@2 = ~I don't need anything at the moment.~
@3 = ~Take a look at what I have to offer...~
@4 = ~As you say.~
@5 = ~You have been warned!~
@6 = ~Hey, don't touch our stuff!~
@7 = ~Welcome, adventurers! You look exhausted from your journey through the planes of existence. If you need a well-deserved rest and a refreshing sleep, I have a comfortable bed for you.~
@8 = ~I would like to rest.~
@9 = ~I don't want to rest at the moment.~
@10 = ~Then make yourselves comfortable...~

@12 = ~Yes. Show me what healing skills you offer.~
@13 = ~No. I have a few questions.~
@14 = ~A moment please...~
@15 = ~I haven't been down here for very long. Ask Igraflyn if you have any questions. He knows this place best of all of us.~
@16 = ~I would still be interested in seeing your healing skills.~
@17 = ~I'll go ask him. Thank you for the information.~
@18 = ~As you wish.~

@24 = ~I think I might need a rest.~
@25 = ~You sell weapons and equipment? Might I take a look?~
@26 = ~Well, for now I have some questions.~
@27 = ~Nothing, I'm leaving.~
@28 = ~This is a home base of the Planar Guild, an association of planewalkers, with the aim of providing a safe haven in the dangerous world of the Multiverse.~
@29 = ~Well, what can I do for you? Do you need healing, a place to rest, or decent weapons and equipment?~
@30 = ~Yes, I am in urgent need of a healer.~

@36 = ~I would like to speak to your healer.~
@37 = ~Bharava is standing at the table. I'm sure she'll be happy to show you what she's got to offer. What else do you need?~
@38 = ~Please feel free to ask any questions, Dwellers of the Material Plane. I hope I have answers to all of them.~
@39 = ~What can you tell me about the Planar Guild?~
@40 = ~How long has the Planar Guild been established?~
@41 = ~I'm looking for a doorway that takes me into Graz'zt's realm in the Abyss.~
@42 = ~What can you tell me about the Infinite Staircase?~
@43 = ~I have to go.~
@44 = ~Our guild is an ancient association of explorers, discoverers, and seekers of knowledge dedicated to the exploration and understanding of the planes of existence. In the vast expanses of the Infinite Staircase, we have created a safe haven from which you can start your journeys to the farthest reaches of the Multiverse.~
@45 = ~Our main goal is to expand and preserve the knowledge of the planes of existence. We firmly believe that understanding these planes not only allows us to better understand ourselves and the world around us, but also to maintain the balance between the worlds.~
@46 = ~We welcome adventurers such as yourself who have the courage and curiosity to face the challenges of the planes of existence. Whether you seek treasures, uncover secrets, or simply quench your thirst for knowledge, our guild offers you a community of like-minded people who want to support and inspire you.~
@47 = ~As guests of our guild, you may gain access to our resources, our library, and the experiences of many generations of explorers who have wandered here before you for a small sum of gold. But be aware that with planewalking comes responsibility. Respect for the planes, their inhabitants, and their secrets is essential to maintaining balance.~
@48 = ~I have other questions.~
@49 = ~The Planar Guild has existed for many centuries and its exact date of origin dates far back into the past. The exact founding of the guild is shrouded in the mists of history and surrounded by legends, so it is difficult to state an exact founding date.~
@50 = ~However, the guild has been maintained and developed over time by generations of adventurers, seekers of knowledge and explorers. Its origins can be traced back to ancient times, when the planes of existence were still mysterious and unexplored. Back then, it was brave and daring explorers who began to venture into the depths of the planes to fathom their knowledge and secrets.~
@51 = ~Over the centuries, the Planar Guild became an established institution that played an important role in the planes of existence. It has become a place of refuge and knowledge transfer for stairsteppers and travelers from all corners of the Multiverse.~
@52 = ~Today, in this era, the Planar Guild stands stronger and more versatile than ever. Our doors are open to all who desire to unveil the mystery of the planes and share their spirit of adventure. We are proud to be a part of this storied community and to share our knowledge with brave souls like you.~
@53 = ~Oh, you have chosen an inhospitable destination, for Graz'zt is a violent and vicious demon lord who rules over three entire layers of the Abyss! His realm is characterized by chaos, corruption and endless cruelty. The creatures that dwell there are unimaginably vicious and merciless.~
@54 = ~If you still wish to seek the door to the Abyss, I urge you to be cautious. The Abyss is a place where the darkest and most violent desires of demons are openly acted out. It is extremely dangerous even for experienced adventurers. Don't you want to travel somewhere else? Does it have to be to one of the most sinister places in the Multiverse?~
@55 = ~Unfortunately, I have no choice. I have to travel to the Abyss.~
@56 = ~I see. I understand that your decision has been made and I do not wish to dissuade you any further. The door to Graz'zt's realm is not far from here, to the north. It is a large portal from which an eerie red glow emanates.~
@57 = ~Actually, travelers pass by from time to time, seeking to travel to Graz'zt's realm for a variety of reasons. Very few ever return. There also seem to be difficulties in casting your usual spells in the Abyss, as the plane corrupts even simple castings.~
@58 = ~I sincerely hope you accomplish your goals and return safely. Should you ever need help or advice, the planar guild is here to assist.~
@59 = ~What do you mean regarding the spells?~
@60 = ~I can't tell you anything more, as no mage of the guild has dared to pass through the door to the Abyss yet. But there seem to be merchants in the Abyss who offer special items for exorbitant prices to make your spells work properly again. But, as I said, I can't provide you with any more information than that for the life of me.~
@61 = ~The Infinite Staircase is a fascinating phenomenon that connects multiple planes of existence. It is a manifestation of the infinite diversity of the Multiverse and a gateway to various worlds and realities.~
@62 = ~The staircase extends seemingly endlessly in all directions and leads to countless different planes. Its exact origins remain a mystery, but it has been around since the dawn of time and has always been revered by the inhabitants of the planes as a place of mystery and potential. It is not a simple physical path, but a conceptual and metaphysical construct. It connects the Multiverse on a layer beyond ordinary imagination. Anyone who steps onto the staircase embarks on a journey through space and time in which the boundaries of reality become blurred. The staircase connects planes that are actually a human lifetime apart in the blink of an eye. It remains a mystery as to how it accomplishes this, but it seems to be drawn to art and creativity above all else, even if it does not apply the same standards to art as we mortals do.~
@63 = ~The Infinite Staircase acts as an important network for travelers, explorers, and adventurers like you who dare to explore the planes. Our planar guild has made its stairs to be a haven from which you can begin and end your journeys, providing you with safety and support.~
@64 = ~As you wish. May you not only discover answers in your travels and explorations, but also pose new questions, because the search for knowledge is as endless as the staircase itself. Farewell.~
